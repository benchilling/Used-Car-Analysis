# Used-Car-Analysis
Project Overview

In this project, we developed a machine learning model to accurately predict used car prices using a variety of car features such as age, model, condition, and mileage. Our primary goal was to help used car dealers set competitive prices and optimize their inventory management.

File Information

vehicles.zip: Contains the original dataset (vehicles.csv) and the Jupyter notebook (prompt_II.ipynb). The files were compressed due to their large size.

prompt_II.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow, including data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.

vehicles.csv: The original dataset used for analysis.

Summary of Findings

After exploring various regression models, we identified the following key findings:

Best Model: Hist Gradient Boosting Regression achieved the highest performance with an R² of 0.98, indicating excellent accuracy.

Key Drivers of Used Car Prices: Car Age, Model, and Condition were the most influential features.

Linear Models (Linear Regression, Ridge Regression) were less effective: These models achieved an R² of only 0.38, indicating that they could not capture the complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

How to Use

Download and unzip the vehicles.zip file.
